# Raspberry-Pi-Camera-Case-and-Mount-Tools

Protective case and mount tools for Raspberry Pi cameras.

Designed by Elizabeth Glover (ejglover@uic.edu)

This was originally designed with the intention of installing the Raspberry Pi camera in a variety of animal behavioral testing environments for neuroscience research purposes. However, it can most certainly be implemented in many other scenarios, such as home surveillance or 3D printer monitoring. This project consists of the camera case, as well as mount arms with internal passages to protect and manage the camera ribbon cable. Some assembly is required.
